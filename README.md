# push_swap
push_swap is a 42 school algorithm project where we must sort a given list of random numbers with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions.

## Usage

Use ```make``` to compile.

Then run it with :

```shell
./push_swap <numbers>
```

The numbers provided can be positive or negative integers. There must not be any duplicates. For example :

```shell
./push_swap 9 0 -217 2147483647 -2147483648
```

If the arguments are valid, the program will output the most efficient list of actions to sort the list.

The program can be checked with the provided checker, like this :

```shell
ARG="3 0 9 2 -1"; ./push_swap $ARG | ./checker $ARG
```

## Push_Swap Rules

The program is only allowed two stacks to work with, stack A and stack B. All the numbers are initially added to stack A, and B is empty.

The possible actions are:

* ```pa``` (push A): Take the first element at the top of B and put it at the top of A. Do nothing if B is empty.
* ```pb``` (push B): Take the first element at the top of A and put it at the top of B. Do nothing if A is empty.
* ```sa``` (swap A): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack A. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.
* ```sb``` (swap B): Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack B. Do nothing if there is only one or no elements.
* ```ss```: ```sa``` and ```sb``` at the same time.
* ```ra``` (rotate A): Shift all elements of stack A up by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
* ```rb``` (rotate B): Shift all elements of stack B up by 1. The first element becomes the last one.
* ```rr```: ```ra``` and ```rb``` at the same time.
* ```rra``` (reverse rotate A): Shift all elements of stack A down by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
* ```rrb``` (reverse rotate B): Shift all elements of stack b down by 1. The last element becomes the first one.
* ```rrr``` : ```rra``` and ```rrb``` at the same time.
